/**
 * Smooth scrolling (Lenis), on its own requestAnimationFrame loop. GSAP is no
 * longer loaded on every page: only the home page uses it, and it hooks its
 * ScrollTrigger into Lenis itself (see Writings.astro).
 *
 * Wiring that matters:
 * - after a client-side navigation, Lenis is re-synced to wherever the router
 *   left the page (top for a new page, the old position on Back, the target for
 *   a #hash) instead of being forced to the top, which used to undo Back;
 * - wheel events over anything that scrolls on its own (code, wide maths,
 *   tables, panels, link previews) scroll that thing, natively;
 * - Lenis re-measures once fonts and images have settled, since both move
 *   everything below them;
 * - reduced motion: no smoothing at all.
