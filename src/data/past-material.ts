  'Algebra 1/2022 Fall': 'Posted by Prof. Upendra Kulkarni on the 2026 Algebra 1 course page.',
  'Algebra 1/2024 Fall':
    "No prescribed textbook; Treil's *Linear Algebra Done Wrong* was recommended. Hard problems, lenient grade cutoffs. The homeworks were quiz prep and weren't submitted.",
  'Analysis 1/2024 Fall':
    "Baby Rudin was the textbook; Arjun used Abbott's *Understanding Analysis* instead (solutions included). The exams ran very long, so carry snacks. The other homeworks were Rudin exercises and aren't here.",
  'Intro to Programming (Haskell)/2024 Fall':
    "Taught from Prof. Suresh's slides, with Hutton as a backup. The course was overhauled from 2025 around a new textbook by Hota, Sharma and Agarwal.",
  'Classical Mechanics 1/2024 Fall':
    "Morin, plus Morin's relativity book for the relativity part and [Kevin Zhou's handouts](https://knzhou.github.io/) for harder problems.",
  'Empowerment with English/2024 Fall':
    "The literature changes every year. The linguistics and speaking parts aren't in the materials.",
  'Calculus 1/2026 Spring': 'The "Problem Sheet" link on the source page was dead, so it is missing.',
