/**
 * Everything to run before pushing, in one go. It only fetches what is missing,
 * so a run with nothing new to do is quick and changes nothing.
 *
 *   npm run sync              all of it
 *   npm run sync -- --no-build    skip the build check at the end
 *
 * Steps, in order:
 *   0. uni        copy ~/Uni into public/uni (scripts/uni.mjs; skipped if ~/Uni is absent)
 *   1. files      copy the files that live elsewhere (CV, course PDFs…) into the site
 *   2. covers     fetch covers for media entries that have none
 *   3. meta       fetch genres, facts and links for entries not looked up yet
 *   4. snapshots  hover-card pictures for links and PDFs that have none
 *   5. build      build the site, to catch broken Markdown or code before Cloudflare does
 * Then it lists what changed, ready to commit.
 *
 * A step that fails (no internet, a source that is down) is reported at the end
 * and the rest still run. It can run alongside `npm run dev`.
 * Not included, since they only need running when their source picture changes:
 * `npm run favicon`, `npm run og`.
